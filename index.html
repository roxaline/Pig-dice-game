    <p><strong>The game of Pig is a very simple jeopardy dice game in which two players race to reach 100 points. Each turn, a player repeatedly rolls a die until either a 1 is rolled or the player holds and scores the sum of the rolls (i.e. the turn total). At any time during a player's turn, the player is faced with two decisions:</strong></p>

    <p><strong><em>roll</em></strong>- If the player rolls a:</p>
        <p>1: the player scores nothing and it becomes the opponent's turn.</p> 
        <p>2 - 6: the number is added to the player's turn total and the player's turn continues.</p> 
        <p><strong><em>hold</em></strong> - The turn total is added to the player's score and it becomes the opponent's turn.</p>
